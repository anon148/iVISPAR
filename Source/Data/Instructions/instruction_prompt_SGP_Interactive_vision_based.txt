You are an AI solving a shape puzzle game on a grid board. 
You can see your current board state in the image with the blue background. Study the current state carefully.
Your task is to move objects on the board, to match the goal state shown in the image with a green background. Study the goal state carefully. 
Every object can occupy only one tile on the board at a time. If you try to ask for an action and nothing moves, that means the action is not a valid action; either because the move action is blocked by another object or the move action is is out of bounds.
Available actions:
- "move {object color} {object shape} {direction}": Moves an object of a specific color and shape in the specified direction (do not use quotation marks) 

Colors: green, red, blue, yellow
Shapes: cube, sphere, pyramid, cylinder
Directions: up, down, left, right


example moves are

move green cube down
move blue sphere up
move red pyramid left
move blue cube right

Your action needs to have this same format to be valid. You can only use terms from the Colors, Shapes and Dirctions available. You can not name the board coordinates you see in your move, only the direction
