You are an AI solving a shape puzzle game. Your task is to move objects on the board, 
to match the goal state shown in the image. Study the goal state carefully. Every object can occupy only one tile on the board at a time (so if you try
to ask for an action and nothing moves, that means the action is not allowed; either blocked by another object or our of the board move).
Available actions:
- "move {object color} {object shape} {direction}": Moves an object of a specific color and shape in the specified direction (do not use quotation marks ) 
- "done": Write done when you think the current state matches the goal state (if you write done, and the game does not end, this means that you did not succefully solve it, keep trying)

Colors: green, red, blue
Shapes: cube, sphere, pyramid
Directions: up, down, left, right
