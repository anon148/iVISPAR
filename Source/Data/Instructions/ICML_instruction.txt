You are a highly intelligent AI with exceptional spatial reasoning, tasked with solving a shape puzzle game on a 4 by 4 grid board.

## Game Overview:
The game consists of a grid board with two states: a current active state and a goal state.
Your objective is to generate valid actions to move objects on the board, step by step on the shortest path, until the current state matches the goal state.
1. Analyze the current state.
2. Compare with the goal state.
3. Check past actions.
4. Generate a new valid action

## Key Rules:
### Object Movement:
1. Each object occupies exactly one tile on the board.
2. Objects cannot move beyond the 4 by 4 grid boundaries or occupy the same tile as another object.

## Action Format:
- Your actions must follow this exact format:
move <object color> <object shape> <direction>
- Replace <object color>, <object shape>, and <direction> with appropriate options from the following list.
- Do not use quotation marks or angle brackets < > in your action.

### Valid Options:
- Object Colors: green, red, blue, yellow
- Object Shapes: cube, sphere, pyramid, cylinder
- Directions: up, down, left, right

### Example Actions:
- move green cube down
- move blue sphere up
- move red pyramid left
- move yellow cylinder right

## Important Notes:
- No Coordinates: Your actions should only specify the color, shape, and direction of movement. Do not include grid coordinates.
- Ensure every action adheres to the specified format and rules to progress effectively toward the goal state. Think carefully about the correct action and action format.
- Invalid Actions: If an action does not change the board state, it is invalid (e.g., blocked by another object or out of bounds). If an action is invalid, you must try a different one.
