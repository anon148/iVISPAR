Task Instructions:

This evaluation tests your understanding of intuitive physical concepts. You will be given a task description and a set of available actions to complete the task. After the task begins, you may only respond using the actions listed, until the task is finished.

You will also receive a visual representation of the environment where your task takes place. Each time you select a valid action, the environment will be updated, and you will see a new image of the task's state. You may only perform one action at a time. If an invalid action is prompted, the game state will remain unchanged, and you will receive an image of the current state again.
